## Node Ecosystem Project
The goal of this project is to demonstrate your understanding of the basic node ecosystem.
(Note - The modules we are installing are purely for practice and won't need to be installed in projects going forwards unless we need them)
* Create a new package.json file
* Install the [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) module
* Install [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) as a dev dependency
* Require Moment in Main.js and console.log the output
* Run your project `node main.js`

If everything works you should see a big object in terminal!
